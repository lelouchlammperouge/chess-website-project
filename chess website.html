<h1>Chess website</h1>
<p>Chess is a very simple yet complex game,<br>
it is easy to learn but almost impossible to master.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Chess is a very fascinating game which requires a lot of visual representation.<br>
Using visual representation you are able to plan ahead multiple moves in a game of chess.<br>
Chess also requires a huge amount of calculations each move, this is becasue there are<br>
practically quadrillions of different combinations in just a few moves of chess.<br>
These combination makes many high level chess games very unique with a battle of the <br>
minds. </p>
